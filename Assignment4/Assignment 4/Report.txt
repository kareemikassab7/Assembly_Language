Assignment 4

Hello, This assignment is composed of four programs:

1- BubbleSort (mips) 
Filename: Bubblesort.asm

-This program take the size of the array from the user
-takes inputs in the array
-then operates recursively to rearrange the values in the array ascendingly
-the values on the screen are displayed separated by commas

2- Binary Search (mips)
Filename: BinarySearch.asm
- Note: this program operates recursively.
- this program will take the input  size from the user
- then it will take an array
- take the required number to be searched for.
- if it locates the element it rreturns its index
- if it doesnt it returns -1
- Note: this program is not finished yet

3- BubbleSort (x86)
Filename: BubbleSortAsm.asm
- this program will take the input from the user
- rearrange the elemens in an ascending manner but not in a recursive way
- Note: this program is not finished yet

4- Binary Search (x86)
Filename: BinarySearchAsm.asm
- this program will take the input from the user
- take the required number to e searched for.
- if it locates the element it rreturns its indext
- if it doesnt it returns -1
- Note: this program is not finished yet
